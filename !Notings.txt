How did we even set this up?
- Ran ModPack.exe to get basic mod XML files.
- Used ROL Big Archiver to extract the multiplayer_data.big in .\data\patch8
- Copied its contents into the game's directory.
- Moved data.big and multiplayer_data.big out of the root data directory.
- Moved soundinfo.big out, as well, so audio.xml can be read from.
- That's all?
